# India Rainfall Prediction
## Motivation and Description
- Long term predictions: Predict rainfall over few weeks/months in advance.
- Short term predictions: Predict rainfall a few days in advance in specific locations.<br>
<p> The main motive of the project is to predict the amount of rainfall in a particular division or state well in advance. 
    We predict the amount of rainfall using past data.</p>

## Dataset
- Dataset1([dataset1](https://data.gov.in/resources/district-rainfall-normal-mm-monthly-seasonal-and-annual-data-period-1951-2000)) 
  This dataset has average rainfall from 1951-2000 for each district, for every month.
- Dataset2([dataset2](https://data.gov.in/resources/subdivision-wise-rainfall-and-its-departure-1901-2015)) 
  This dataset has average rainfall for every year from 1901-2015 for each state.

## Methodology
- Date Cleaning conduct experiments.
- Analysis of Data and rainfall pattern for the experiment.
- Predict the average rainfall by separating data into training and
  testing.Apply various statistical and machine learning approaches(*SVM*,
  etc) in prediction and make analysis over various approaches to minimize the error
